# HSNXT.Extensions
This library is perhaps an example of when you just have *too much* of something. Don't use it. Pick a smaller extension method library, or individually copy the extension methods you actually intend to use.

Almost none of the code that can be found here is decent. Since it's almost entirely imported from other libraries, it's also not a good representation of the way I code.

This repository is only kept up to comply with the GPL terms (along with any other code that may be included that also demands disclosure of the source code in their licenses).

If you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel, a handful of these are unique and possibly not terrible:
